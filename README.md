Hello! I am a library paraprofessional who likes learning new technologies and drawing comics. This is a repository for organizing personal projects.

## Projects

- 2021.Mar_[Practice room](/practice_room/) ![Thumbnail gif animation](/images/practice-thumb.gif)
    - Small interactive web experience inspired by music school practice rooms. Pace around and practice your instrument!
    - Models created in **Blender**; code written using **Threejs** and **Tonejs**.
- 2021.Feb_[Kindergarden art period](/kinder_art/) ![Thumbnail gif animation](/images/kinder-thumb.gif)
    - Interactive web experience inspired by memories of doodling in grade school. Doodle on the paper (or the desk) and get a savable file with a gold star from the teacher. Maybe put it on the refrigerator?
    - Created as an experiment in combining **Threejs** with **HTML5 Canvas**.
- 2021.Jan_[Sci-fi weather app](/weather/) ![Thumbnail gif animation](/images/weather-thumb.gif)
    - A weather app, but imagine you are in an intergalactic command center. Inspired by all the fun-looking interfaces in sci-fi visual media.
    - Created while learning about **APIs** and **p5js**.
- 2020.Dec_[Lemmings](/lemmings/) ![Thumbnail gif animation](/images/lemmings-thumb.gif)
    - Game imitating the puzzle game *Lemmings*. Mostly broken, but it was an exciting early learning experience and I hope to return to it someday.
    - Created while learning about **HTML5** and **vanilla JS**.
