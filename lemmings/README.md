# Lemmings

Early attempt at recreating [Lemmings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)) while learning JS and HTML Canvas.

I learned a lot from this project but I've realized the grid system isn't the best way to do this kind of game (as much as it was fun to draw the levels in this way), and there's a lot of messiness.

I hope to rewrite this in the future once I have a little more knowledge.
